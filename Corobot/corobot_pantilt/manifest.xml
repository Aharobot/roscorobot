  <description brief="corobot_pantilt">

     corobot_pantilt is actually the package logitech_pantilt from Dallas Geocker that was just renamed and integrated in corobot stack for an easy installation of the Corobot stack.
     The script executing mjpg-streamer necessary for the logitech_pantilt package has been integrated in this corobot_pantilt package. Now you won't have to download mjpg-streamer and execute the script yourself, only a make in the corobot_pantilt/src/mjpg-streamer/ folder is necessary.
